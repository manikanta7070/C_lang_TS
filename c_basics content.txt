C Language Introduction : 

Writing the First Program in C :

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a = 10;
  printf("%d", a);
  return 0;  
}

#output : 10

#Structure of the C program

components of the c program

   1 > Header Files Inclusion – Line 1 [#include <stdio.h>]

      stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
      stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
      stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
      stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, and memory allocation
      string.h – Defines string handling functions
      math.h – Defines common mathematical functions. 

   2 > Main Method Declaration – Line 2 [int main()]  
      
     It is the entry point of a C program and the execution typically begins with the first line of the main().
  
   3 >  Body of Main Method – Line 3 to Line 6 [enclosed in {}]

      It can be anything like manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, etc
    
   4. > Statement – Line 4 [printf(“Hello World”);]

      Statements are the instructions given to the compiler. In C, a statement is always terminated by a semicolon (;).

   5. >The return statement refers to the return values from a function. This return statement and return value depend upon the return type of the function.                          return statement in our program returns the value from main().
